snake game kaio

The snake starts the game with just one unit in size.

At the beginning of the game the SCORE shows 1 unit, thanks to the size of the snake.

Apples land in random positions throughout the game.

One unit of size for the snake will be added to each apple eaten.

The snake can touch the edges of the area, these being mirrored.

The snake cannot touch itself, in which case a red color will appear and it
will revert to one size unit and the score will return to one.

With each apple eaten, the snake quickly turns green and then returns to its original color.

thanks
and have fun!
